# Sports by Skill Dashboard Project

This Data Visualization project displays the ESPN's 2018/W19: Toughest Sport by Skill dataset. The output is a Dashboard that contains 3 plots: A Heatmap that shows the Score of the 10 skills that the dataset has by Sport. A Barplot containing the detailed skills that you can filter by sport, and a Horizontal line plot or Lollipop plot that contains the top sports by skill with a filter by skill.

I am aware that the best way to visualize this small dataset is a table, but the goal is to highlight my ability to make dashboards and data visualizations. 

You can find the dashboard here at: https://nicolaszuleta95.netlify.app/html/skillsbysport
